# corrupted_document_challenge
<b>Problem context</b>

An English document has been corrupted in an unusual manner. Each alphabetic word (no numbers, but apostrophes allowed) has had every other character replaced with a # character. For example, a sentence like I'm here. It's a cat. would appear in the document as I#m h#r#. I#'# a c#t. We have extracted the tokens from this corrupted document and have provided the list of tokens to you as corrupted_tokens.txt. Note that the order of tokens in the list is the same as how they appeared in the original document, and that surrounding punctuation like . and , have been removed. As an example, if the uncorrupted document is: I'm here. It's a cat. the its corresponding corruption followed by tokenization would be: I#m h#r# I#'# a c#t  For further details please read the accompanying pdf file.
